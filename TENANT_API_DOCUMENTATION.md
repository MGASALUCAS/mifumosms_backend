# üè¢ Tenant Management API Documentation

## Overview

The Tenant Management API provides comprehensive multi-tenant functionality for the Mifumo WMS platform. It allows users to create, manage, and switch between different business organizations (tenants), manage team members, and configure custom domains.

## üîê Authentication

All endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

## üè¢ Multi-Tenant Architecture

The system uses a multi-tenant architecture where:
- Each user can belong to multiple tenants
- Each tenant has its own isolated data
- Users can switch between tenants they have access to
- All billing, messaging, and other data is tenant-scoped

- **Role**: Must be one of: owner, admin, agent
- **Uniqueness**: User cannot be invited twice to same tenant

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. Tenant Creation
1. User creates tenant via `POST /api/tenants/`
2. System automatically creates owner membership
3. Default domain is created (subdomain.mifumo.local)
4. Trial period starts (30 days)

### 2. Member Invitation
1. Admin/owner invites member via `POST /api/tenants/{id}/members/`
2. System sends invitation email with token
3. User clicks link to accept invitation
4. Membership status changes to active

### 3. Tenant Switching
1. User calls `POST /api/tenants/switch/` with tenant ID
2. System validates user has access to tenant
3. Current tenant context is updated
4. All subsequent requests are scoped to new tenant

### 4. Domain Management
1. Admin adds custom domain via `POST /api/tenants/{id}/domains/`
2. Domain verification process begins
3. Once verified, domain can be set as primary
4. Old primary domain becomes secondary

## üîß Error Handling

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "field_name": ["Error message"],
  "non_field_errors": ["General error message"]
}
```

### Common Validation Errors
- `"This subdomain is already taken"` - Subdomain already exists
- `"Subdomain can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores"` - Invalid characters
- `"Subdomain cannot start or end with a hyphen"` - Invalid format
- `"User is already a member of this tenant"` - Duplicate membership
- `"You don't have access to this tenant"` - Insufficient permissions
- `"User not found"` - Email doesn't exist in system

### HTTP Status Codes
- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request (validation errors)
- `401` - Unauthorized (missing/invalid token)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Internal Server Error

## üöÄ Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse:
- 100 requests per hour per user for tenant operations
- 50 requests per hour per user for member management
- 20 requests per hour per user for domain management
- Burst allowance: 10 requests per second

## üìù Notes

1. **Automatic Tenant Creation**: New users automatically get a tenant created
2. **Trial Period**: All new tenants get 30-day trial period
3. **Domain Verification**: Custom domains require verification before use
4. **Member Limits**: Free tier has member limits, paid tiers have higher limits
5. **Data Isolation**: All tenant data is completely isolated
6. **Owner Transfer**: Owners can transfer ownership to other members
7. **Soft Delete**: Deleted tenants are soft-deleted and can be restored
8. **Audit Trail**: All tenant operations are logged for compliance

### Messaging Integration
- Sender IDs are tenant-scoped
- SMS campaigns are isolated by tenant

### User Management
