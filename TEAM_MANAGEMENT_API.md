## üîß Frontend Integration

### Example: List Team Members
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/tenants/{tenant_id}/team/', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const teamMembers = await response.json();
```

### Example: Invite Member
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/tenants/{tenant_id}/team/invite/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'newmember@company.com',
    role: 'agent'
  })
});
```

### Example: Accept Invitation
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/invite/${token}/accept/`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

## üö® Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**: Invitation tokens are randomly generated and expire
2. **Role Validation**: Server-side validation prevents privilege escalation
3. **Email Verification**: Invitations are sent to verified email addresses
4. **Audit Trail**: All membership changes are logged with timestamps
5. **Permission Checks**: Every action is validated against user permissions

## üìä Database Schema

### Membership Model
```python
class Membership(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True)
    tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role = models.CharField(choices=['owner', 'admin', 'agent'])
    status = models.CharField(choices=['active', 'pending', 'suspended'])
    invited_by = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True, blank=True)
    invited_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    joined_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    invitation_token = models.CharField(max_length=32, blank=True, null=True)
```

This comprehensive team management system provides all the functionality needed for managing team members in a multi-tenant application with proper security and role-based access control.
