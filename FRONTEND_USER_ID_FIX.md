# Frontend User ID Filtering Fix

## Problem Identified

The frontend is successfully fetching sender ID requests from the API, but it's filtering them out because the user ID comparison is failing:

```
Filtering out request from other user: undefined User ID: undefined Current User ID: 62
Filtered results for current user: []
```

## Root Cause

The frontend is not correctly extracting the user ID from the API response. The API is returning the correct data:

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "2615873f-eb7d-4677-8a61-62dffe449188",
      "user": 77,
      "user_id": 77,
      "requested_sender_id": "API2121",
      "status": "pending",
      "user_email": "apiresponse@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Frontend Fix Required

### 1. Check User ID Extraction

In your `useSenderNames.ts` file, make sure you're extracting the user ID correctly:

```javascript
// OLD (incorrect)
const userId = request.user; // This might be undefined

// NEW (correct)
const userId = request.user_id || request.user; // Try both fields
```

### 2. Update Filtering Logic

```javascript
// In your filtering logic
const filteredResults = results.filter(request => {
  const requestUserId = request.user_id || request.user;
  const currentUserId = getCurrentUserId(); // Make sure this returns the correct ID
  
  console.log('Request User ID:', requestUserId);
  console.log('Current User ID:', currentUserId);
  
  return requestUserId === currentUserId;
});
```

### 3. Debug the User ID

Add debugging to see what's happening:

```javascript
// Add this debugging
console.log('Raw request object:', request);
console.log('Request.user:', request.user);
console.log('Request.user_id:', request.user_id);
console.log('Current user ID:', currentUserId);
```

### 4. Alternative: Remove Filtering

If the API is already returning only the current user's requests, you might not need filtering at all:

```javascript
// Instead of filtering, just use the results directly
const senderNames = results.map(request => ({
  id: request.id,
  senderId: request.requested_sender_id,
  status: request.status,
  createdAt: request.created_at
}));
```

## API Response Structure

The API returns this structure for each request:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "tenant": "tenant-uuid", 
  "user": 77,                    // User ID (integer)
  "user_id": 77,                 // User ID (integer) - same as user
  "requested_sender_id": "API2121",
  "sample_content": "Message content",
  "status": "pending",
  "user_email": "user@example.com",
  "tenant_name": "Organization Name",
  "created_at": "2025-10-19T18:21:49.435729Z"
}
```

## Quick Test

To test if this is the issue, temporarily remove the filtering:

```javascript
// Comment out the filtering temporarily
// const filteredResults = results.filter(request => {
//   return request.user_id === currentUserId;
// });

// Use all results
const filteredResults = results;
```

If you see the requests after removing the filter, then the issue is definitely in the user ID comparison logic.

## Expected Result

After fixing the user ID extraction, you should see:

```
Filtering out request from other user: 77 User ID: 77 Current User ID: 77
Filtered results for current user: [1 request]
```

The system is working correctly on the backend - the issue is just in the frontend user ID extraction and comparison logic.
