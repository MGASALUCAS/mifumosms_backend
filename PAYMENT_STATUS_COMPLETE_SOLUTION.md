# Payment Status Fix - Complete Solution

## üö® Problem Solved

Your payment records were showing hyphens (`-`) and "Failed" status instead of proper status updates from Zenopay. The issue was that:

1. **CANCELLED payments were not being handled** - Zenopay was returning "CANCELLED" status but your system only checked for "COMPLETED" and "FAILED"
2. **Webhook verification was not configured** - `ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK` setting was missing
3. **No manual sync mechanism** - No way to manually update payment statuses

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Payment Status Handling

Updated all payment processing functions to handle "CANCELLED" status:

- **`check_payment_status`** - Now marks CANCELLED payments as failed
- **`verify_payment`** - Now handles CANCELLED status with appropriate message
- **`sync_pending_payments`** - Now processes CANCELLED payments
- **`payment_webhook`** - Now handles CANCELLED webhook notifications

### 2. Added Webhook Configuration

Added `ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK` setting to `mifumo/settings.py`:

```python
ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK = config("ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK", default=False, cast=bool)
```

### 3. Created Management Command

Created `sync_payment_status` management command for manual payment sync:

```bash
# Sync all pending payments
python manage.py sync_payment_status

# Force sync (ignore webhook requirement)
python manage.py sync_payment_status --force

# Sync for specific tenant
python manage.py sync_payment_status --tenant-id TENANT_ID
```

### 4. Updated API Endpoints

All payment status endpoints now properly handle:
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Payment successful
- ‚ùå **FAILED** - Payment failed
- üö´ **CANCELLED** - Payment cancelled by user or expired
- ‚è≥ **PENDING** - Payment still processing

## üîß How to Use

### Immediate Fix (Sync All Payments)

```bash
# Run this command to update all pending payments
python manage.py sync_payment_status
```

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Check specific payment status
GET /api/billing/payments/transactions/{transaction_id}/status/

# Sync all pending payments for your tenant
POST /api/billing/payments/sync/

# Verify payment by order ID
GET /api/billing/payments/verify/{order_id}/
```

### Environment Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# Enable webhook verification (recommended for production)
ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK=True

# Or disable for testing (current default)
ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK=False
```

## üìä Results

After running the sync command, your payment records will show:

- **Status: "failed"** for CANCELLED payments (with reason "Payment cancelled by user or expired")
- **Status: "completed"** for successful payments
- **Status: "failed"** for failed payments
- **Status: "pending"** for payments still processing

## üéØ What This Fixes

1. **Accurate Payment Status** - All payments now show correct status from Zenopay
2. **CANCELLED Payment Handling** - Cancelled payments are properly marked as failed
3. **Manual Sync Capability** - You can manually sync payment status anytime
4. **Webhook Configuration** - Proper webhook verification setup
5. **Better Error Messages** - Clear messages for different failure types

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Run the sync command** to update all existing payments
2. **Configure webhook URL** in Zenopay dashboard: `https://your-domain.com/api/billing/payments/webhook/`
3. **Set ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK=True** in production
4. **Monitor payment statuses** using the dashboard

## üìù Files Modified

- `mifumo/settings.py` - Added webhook configuration
- `billing/views_payment.py` - Updated all payment status functions
- `billing/management/commands/sync_payment_status.py` - New management command
- `test_payment_sync.py` - Test script (can be deleted)

## ‚úÖ Verification

Your payment dashboard should now show:
- Proper status updates instead of hyphens
- "Failed" status for cancelled payments
- "Completed" status for successful payments
- Accurate payment history

The payment status issue is now completely resolved! üéâ
