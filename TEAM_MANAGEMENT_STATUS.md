# Team Management Status

## Current Situation

**Tenant**: Test Organization (e745958e-282d-45b8-9f3c-630509d28928)

**Members in Database**:
1. admin@mifumo.com - owner - active ✅
2. magesa133@gmail.com - agent - pending ⏳
3. magesa123@gmail.com - agent - pending ⏳  
4. notification-test@example.com - owner - pending ⏳

## The Issue

You tried to invite `magesa133@gmail.com` again, but they're **already** a member with status "pending". 

**Error**: "User is already a member of this tenant"

## The Solution

### Option 1: Accept the Invitation (if you're the user)
- Click the invitation link in the email
- Or use the accept endpoint: `POST /api/invite/{token}/accept/`

### Option 2: Delete and Re-invite
Remove the pending member and send a new invitation.

### Option 3: Show Pending Members in List
The team list endpoint should show pending members, not hide them.

## Email Sending Status

### If you configured email:
✅ Email was sent successfully when member was created

### If you didn't configure email:
❌ Email failed to send, but member was still created with invitation token

**To enable email**:
1. Create `.env` file in project root
2. Add your Gmail credentials (App Password):
```env
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```
3. Restart the server

## What Works Now

✅ Team invitation endpoint (`POST /api/tenants/{id}/team/invite/`)
- Creates pending memberships
- Generates invitation tokens
- Sends email (if configured)

✅ Team list endpoint (`GET /api/tenants/{id}/team/`)
- Shows all team members including pending

⚠️ **Issue**: Duplicate invitations are prevented (by design)

## Next Steps

1. **Check if email was sent**: Look in `magesa133@gmail.com` inbox (or spam)
2. **If no email**: Configure SMTP in `.env` file and resend invitation
3. **Or manually share**: Use the invitation token from database to share link

## Test Invitation API

Try inviting a different email:
```bash
POST /api/tenants/e745958e-282d-45b8-9f3c-630509d28928/team/invite/

{
  "email": "newperson@example.com",
  "role": "agent"
}
```

This should work!
