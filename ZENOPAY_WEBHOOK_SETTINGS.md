# ZenoPay Webhook Verification Settings

## Problem Fixed
The payment history was showing "Completed" status for test/sample records that were never verified by ZenoPay webhooks. This caused confusion because users saw completed payments but no actual money in their accounts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Reset Sample Records
- All test/sample payment records have been reset to "pending" status
- Only real ZenoPay webhooks can now mark payments as "completed"

### 2. Webhook Verification Enforcement
Add this setting to your Django settings to enforce webhook verification:

```python
# In your settings.py or .env
ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK = True
```

### 3. How It Works Now

**Before (Problem):**
- Sample records were marked "completed" without ZenoPay verification
- Users saw completed payments but no actual funds

**After (Fixed):**
- Only ZenoPay webhooks can mark payments as "completed"
- Status polling keeps payments as "pending" until webhook arrives
- Payment history shows accurate status

### 4. Payment Flow

1. **Payment Initiated**: Status = "pending"
2. **User Pays on Mobile**: Status remains "pending"
3. **ZenoPay Webhook**: Status changes to "completed" (only if verified)
4. **Credits Added**: Only after webhook confirmation

### 5. Current Status
All existing records are now "pending" and will only be marked "completed" when:
- ZenoPay sends a webhook with `payment_status: "COMPLETED"`
- The webhook is verified with ZenoPay API
- `webhook_received` flag is set to `True`

### 6. Testing Real Payments
To test with real payments:
1. Set `ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK = True` in settings
2. Ensure webhook URL is accessible: `https://your-domain.com/api/billing/payments/webhook/`
3. Make a real payment through the frontend
4. Complete payment on mobile
5. Wait for ZenoPay webhook to mark it "completed"

### 7. Manual Sync (if needed)
If a payment is stuck as "pending" but you know it was completed:
```bash
# This will check ZenoPay and update status
POST /api/billing/payments/sync/
```

## Result
- ✅ No more false "completed" statuses
- ✅ Only verified ZenoPay payments show as completed
- ✅ Payment history reflects actual payment status
- ✅ Users see accurate account status
