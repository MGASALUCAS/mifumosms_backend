# Payment Status Fix - Zenopay Integration

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your payment records show hyphens (`-`) and "Failed" status instead of "Completed" even when payments have been successfully processed through Zenopay. This is because:

1. **Webhook Verification Not Enabled**: `ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK` setting is not configured
2. **Webhook Not Receiving Updates**: Zenopay webhooks may not be reaching your server
3. **Manual Sync Not Being Used**: The system has a sync endpoint but it's not being utilized

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Enable Webhook Verification (Recommended)

Add this to your Django settings:

```python
# In mifumo/settings.py
ZENOPAY_REQUIRE_WEBHOOK = True
```

### 2. Manual Payment Sync (Immediate Fix)

Use the existing sync endpoint to update all pending payments:

```bash
# Sync all pending payments for your tenant
curl -X POST https://mifumosms.servehttp.com/api/billing/payments/sync/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 3. Individual Payment Status Check

Check specific payment status:

```bash
# Check specific payment by transaction ID
curl -X GET https://mifumosms.servehttp.com/api/billing/payments/transactions/TRANSACTION_ID/status/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
